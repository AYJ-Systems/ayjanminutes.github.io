# AI Note Taker

Professional Windows audio recorder with an intuitive GUI that captures mic + system audio simultaneously, then:
1. **Transcribes** using local `faster-whisper` models (no API calls)
2. **Generates AI meeting minutes** using Claude or OpenAI API (optional)

Records as stereo WAV, transcripts saved as plain text, and structured meeting minutes exported as professionally-formatted Word documents.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Installer (Recommended)
Download the latest stub installer from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/AYJ-Systems/ai_note_taker_releases/releases/tag/setup-installer).

Run `AI-Note-Taker-Setup.exe` — it's a small (~15 MB) installer that downloads and installs the full app. During setup you can optionally download the Whisper transcription model so it is ready before your first meeting. No Python or manual setup needed.

On first run, the GUI will prompt you to enter your API key (optional, for AI meeting minutes). The app saves your key securely for future use.

## Setup for Meeting Minutes (Optional)

To generate AI-powered meeting minutes you need an API key from either **Claude** (Anthropic) or **OpenAI**:

**Step 1: Get API Key**
- **Claude**: Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and create an account, then generate an API key
- **OpenAI**: Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and create an API key

**Step 2: Enter your key in the GUI**
- Launch `python gui.py` or open the standalone .exe
- On first run, the app will detect no key and prompt you to enter it
- Select "Save API Key" to store it securely in `.env` for future use

### Main Features in GUI

## Output

After recording, files are saved to your Documents folder:
- **Audio**: `Documents/ai_note_taker/recordings/meeting_20260312_222558.wav` (stereo, 48kHz)
- **Transcript**: `Documents/ai_note_taker/transcripts/raw/meeting_20260312_222558.txt` (plain text)
- **Meeting Minutes** (if enabled):
  - `Documents/ai_note_taker/meeting_minutes/meeting_20260312_222558_minutes.txt` (markdown)
  - `Documents/ai_note_taker/meeting_minutes/meeting_20260312_222558_minutes.docx` (formatted Word doc)

### Meeting Minutes Format

The Word document is formatted according to your template and includes:
- **Header Info**: Project, Date, Time, Location, Attendees, Apologies, Objective
- **Agenda Items**: Detailed table with Issues, Decisions, Action Items for each item
- **Questions**: Open questions raised during the meeting
- **Next Meeting**: Scheduled date/time if mentioned
- **Action Items Summary**: Color-coded by owner (🟢 Internal, 🟡 External, 🔵 Cross-party)

## Attendee Name Recognition

When generating meeting minutes, the app passes a list of possible attendee names to Claude so it can correct spelling errors from the Whisper transcription (e.g. "Ning" → "Naing").

Names are stored in `assets/possible_names.csv` and managed via **Names** in the main menu.

Names in the list are treated as *possible* attendees — Claude only uses names that appear in the transcript and does not add unlisted people as attendees.

You can also edit `assets/possible_names.csv` directly (one name per row, with a `name` header).

## faster-whisper Models

| Model    | Size  | Speed | Accuracy |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| tiny     | 39M   | Fast  | Lower    |
| base     | 140M  | Fast  | Good     |
| small    | 244M  | ~1x   | Better   |
| medium   | 769M  | ~2x   | Very Good|
| large-v3 | ~1.5G | ~4x   | Best     |
| turbo    | ~809M | Fast  | Very Good|

**The installer downloads the model during setup** (if you check the option). If you skip it, the model downloads automatically on your first transcription.

**Cache location:**
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\ai_note_taker\models\`
- Models are cached after first download (one-time only)
- Safe to delete the folder to free space — the model will re-download on next use

## GPU Acceleration

By default, transcription runs on CPU. For NVIDIA GPU acceleration (3–5x faster), follow these steps:

### Enable GPU Transcription

**Step 1: Install CUDA Toolkit 12.x**

Download from [NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-9-1-download-archive):
- Select **Windows**, **x86_64**, **12.x** (latest 12.x version), **exe (local)**
- Run the installer with default settings

**Step 2: Verify CUDA is installed**
```bash
nvcc --version
```
Should show version 12.x

**Step 3: Enable GPU in config.yaml**
```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true
  model_size: medium
  device: auto    # auto (GPU if available), cuda (GPU only), or cpu
```

**Step 4: Verify GPU is working**
```bash
python -c "import ctranslate2; print(ctranslate2.get_supported_compute_types('cuda'))"
```
Should print: `['float32', 'float16', 'int8_float16', 'int8']`

### Configuration Options

- **`device: auto`** (default) — Uses GPU if available, falls back to CPU automatically
- **`device: cuda`** — Forces GPU only (errors if CUDA unavailable)
- **`device: cpu`** — Forces CPU (ignores GPU)

### Performance

GPU transcription is typically **3–5x faster** than CPU on medium/large models:
- **CPU (int8)**: ~1x speed
- **GPU (float16)**: ~3–5x speed

**CPU is fine for:** Quick notes, small models (tiny/base)
**GPU is recommended for:** Large models (medium/large-v3), long recordings

## Limitations

- Speech-only: Music and non-speech audio are filtered out
- Accuracy depends on audio quality (noise, clarity, volume)

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Issues

**No audio captured**
- Open the GUI and check the **Select Microphone** and **Select Speaker** dropdowns
- Verify all available devices are showing in the dropdowns
- Verify mic and speaker are working in Windows Settings

**Audio is quiet or distorted**
- Check Windows volume levels for mic and system audio
- Try adjusting gain in device settings
- Try a different microphone from the dropdown

### Transcription Issues

**Transcription not running**
- Verify `transcription.enabled: true` in `config.yaml`
- Check `faster-whisper` is installed: `pip install faster-whisper`
- Verify you have enough disk space for model cache (~1-5GB)

**Transcription is very slow**
- If the model wasn't downloaded during installation, the first transcription downloads it — wait for completion
- Subsequent runs use the cached model from `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\ai_note_taker\models\`
- Try smaller model: change `model_size: tiny` or `base` in Settings
- **Enable GPU**: Install CUDA Toolkit 12.x for 3–5x speedup (see [GPU Acceleration](#gpu-acceleration) section)

**GPU errors (CUDA not found, cublas DLL missing, etc.)**
- Install **CUDA Toolkit 12.x** from [NVIDIA's archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads-archive)
- Verify CUDA is available: 
  ```bash
  nvcc --version
  ```
  Should show version 12.x
- Test ctranslate2 support:
  ```bash
  python -c "import ctranslate2; print(ctranslate2.get_supported_compute_types('cuda'))"
  ```
  Should print: `['float32', 'float16', 'int8_float16', 'int8']`
- If still failing, fall back to CPU: change `device: cpu` in `config.yaml`

**Transcription fails on audio file**
- For non-WAV formats (MP3, M4A, FLAC): install ffmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
- Add ffmpeg to Windows PATH or place in `utils/` folder

### Meeting Minutes Issues

**Meeting minutes not generating**
- Go to **Settings** and toggle **Enable Summarization** ON
- Enter your Claude API key when prompted (or paste it from your Anthropic console)
- Restart the app after entering the key

**"No API key provided" error**
- Click the API Key field in Settings and enter your key from https://console.anthropic.com
- Key should start with `sk-ant-`
- Click "Save API Key" to store it securely

**Invalid/expired API key**
- Get a new key from https://console.anthropic.com
- Clear the key field in Settings and enter the new one
- Click "Save API Key" and restart the app

**Word document formatting issues**
- Ensure `assets/meeting_minutes_TEMPLATE.docx` exists in the app directory
- Ensure `assets/note_taker_prompt.txt` exists (meeting minutes prompt template)
- Try re-transcribing the recording to regenerate minutes

### General

**"Module not found" errors**
- Activate venv: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Permission denied on venv/Scripts/**
- Right-click Command Prompt → "Run as Administrator"
- Then activate venv and try again
